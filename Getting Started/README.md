# Getting Started
These pages are to help you get started using Riviera.
They include definitions of common words or terms, instructions on the basics of Linux and Riviera, and much more (eventually)!

Topics to add:
- Common Definitions
- What is a "high-performance compute" (HPC) cluster?
  - How does it differ from a regular computer, or a bunch of regular computers?
- What is Riviera?
  - It's an on-campus cluster
  - Costs
- Fair share usage
  - Storage capacity
- Dos and Don'ts
  - Do: debug your code before running it here
  - Don't: use GUI programs
  - Don't: use IDEs (VSCode, PyCharm, etc.) incorrectly
    - Once pages are made for using them correctly, link them in here.
## How to Connect 
  ### Off Campus
  The first step to accessing Riviria is to make sure your computer can talk to the Riviria's login computer. If you are on campus and connected to the wifi then you're good to go! If not you need to set up and connect to the CSU VPN. Luckily, CSU IT has a very good tutorial with pictures for each step. First, click [here](https://it.colostate.edu/cybersecurity/globalprotect-vpn/#install-agent) to install a program called "Global Protect". Next, setup Global Protect by following the steps [here](https://it.colostate.edu/cybersecurity/globalprotect-vpn/#gp-connect-PC-mac). When you connect to Global Protect, your computer now acts as if it's using CSU's wifi even though you're remote.
  - SSH setup
  - Connecting via the terminal
  - Using MobaXTerm, Putty, etc.
  - Reiterate the point of not using an IDE (or using it correctly)
- Changing your password
  - The `passwd` command
  - Who to contact if you can't log in
- Linux basics
  - Moving around: `cd`, `ls`, `pushd`, `popd`, etc.
  - Editing files: `nano`, `vim`, `emacs`
  - Moving files locally: `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`
  - Moving files remotely: `scp`, `rsync`, `git`, FileZilla
- The module system
- Link to the "Slurm" category for job submissions, etc.
