# Riviera Documentation
This is our central document repository for the Riviera HPC cluster at Colorado State University.
Here, you'll find helpful information about how to use Riviera, or even HPC clusters in general.

## What's All Here?
There are a few main areas in this repository: the "Code" page, "Discussions", and "Issues".

The main area is the "Code" page (which is where you are now).
Here, you'll see a number of folders (at the top).
Each folder is a broad category containing a variety of topics.
If you're new to using Riviera (or Linux in general), check out the [Getting Started](./Getting%20Started/README.md) page!

The "Discussions" page is a place where people can ask questions and share ideas.
If you want some help solving a problem, have some small tips or tricks, or found a cool piece of code, feel free to post it here!
Since this is a university page, we just ask that everyone be civil and stay on-topic.

The "Issues" page acts like a to-do list for everyone adding to the documents.
You can use this page to report problems with documents or ask us to add new information.

## Where to Begin?
If you're not sure where to start, here are some good suggestions!

- [Getting Started](./Getting%20Started/README.md): If you're new to Linux, or just new to Riviera, check this out!
- [Python](./Python/README.md): How to use Python on Riviera.
- More pages are coming soon!

## Plans for the Future
Here is the information we're planning to provide in the future.
If there's one that you particularly want, check for it on the "Issues" page and let us know you're interested!

- Contributing
  - The branch/edit/PR workflow
  - Standards and practices
- Slurm
  - Descriptions of the partitions
  - Slurm/sbatch tutorials
  - Interactive jobs
- R programming
- Matlab programming
- Using IDEs
  - Correctly using VSCode, Jupyter, PyCharm, RSudio, Matlab (GUI), etc.
- Containers (Docker, Singularity)

- GPUs
  - When to use one (vs CPUs)
  - How to use one
  - When to use multiple (vs just one)
  - How to use multiple
  - How to profile your GPU code
    - This should probably go with job profiling, but there should be a link to it here still
- Job profiling
  - Using `top` or `htop` to quickly check CPU usage
  - Using `free` or `htop` (again) to quickly check memory usage
  - Using `nvidia-smi` to quickly check GPU usage
  - How to profile your CPU code
  - How to profile your GPU code

## How to Contribute
There are a variety of ways to contribute!
The "Discussions" page is a good spot for small tips and tricks, or for questions.
If you found an error or want to request new information, use the "Issues" page.
Otherwise, if you want to help us maintain all these documents, check out the "Contributing" category (coming soon).
